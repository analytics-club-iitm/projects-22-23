We apply these techniques to solve various problems pertaining to Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Reinforcement Learning, and many more!

    <span style="color: red;">NEW!</span> <i>We are also hosting "Mini Projects" which are essentially short term (max: 1 month), quick outcome-based projects spread across an entire year. 
    The selections for the same will be based on interaction and involvement in club sessions. Further details will be intimated at the time of selections!</i>
</p>

<p>
    All the above mentioned projects are <b>OPEN FOR ALL</b> and we <b>DO NOT</b> expect any pre-requisites to apply for them. 
    The selection proceedure would involve a small task (related to the project itself) followed by an interview upon successful submission of the task. 
    We will be providing a detailed-guide for each task suggesting pointers on how to proceed to solve it. 
    The selection proceedure is mainly to gauge your motivation, capacity to learn rather than your existing technical skills.
