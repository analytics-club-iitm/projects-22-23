<h1>
    <center>Project Pingala: Speech Synthesis for Sanskrit Verse</center>
</h1>

# Description

Sanskrit is a beautiful language consisting of various meters and tunes. It’s recent involvement with artificial intelligence (and recognition from NASA) is an honor proving its power for being a valuable course of literature. The synthesizer takes in Sanskrit text as an input, considers the “meter” in which a given verse is composed, and modulates the syllables accordingly to generate speech.
Many great Sanskrit scholars struggle to recite verses written using meters like Āryā, which are tough to recite. There has been close to no work on Text-to-Speech models in Sanskrit. This tool would aid scholars and learners in improving their pronunciation of Sanskrit verses. We are also planning to create a dataset publicly to encourage more research in this field. Future goals include generalizing the approach adopted here to other languages like Tamil, Telugu, etc. 
The below example depicts how very similar-looking verses are pronounced entirely differently meters.

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple) selection task and state why you want to be part of the project. The task involves parts: 
- Implementation of a simple Neural Network from scratch (using Pytorch),
- Additional questions which are related to the project itself. There is no right or wrong answer to these questions and its basically to understand your thought process.

> **TIP**: Deep Learning was invented to mimic how a neuron/human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they MUST have some intuition backing them.

# Submission Deadline

Completed applications are to be submitted by **16th May 2022 11:59PM**!
