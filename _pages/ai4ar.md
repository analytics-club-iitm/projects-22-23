    <center>AI4AR: Text Guided Object Hallucination</center>
</h1>

# Description


Ever visualized crazy objects? Or have you seen an Avocado-shaped chair? Is it possible to generate such images? Have you heard of <a href="https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/">DALL·E</a>, which creates images from text captions? 
This project aims to generate realistic 3D object renders (generating the geometry and color of a wide range of objects without 3D supervision) from text descriptions. Future works could include focusing on a particular domain like MRI Scans etc. 
The video is an example of a 3D render of ‘a robot in the shape of a dog.’

# Application Process

To apply for this project one must attempt to solve a (simple) selection task and state why you want to be part of the project. The task involves parts: 
- Implementation of a simple Neural Network from scratch (using Pytorch),
- Additional questions which are related to the project itself. There is no right or wrong answer to these questions and its basically to understand your thought process.

> **TIP**: Deep Learning was invented to mimic how a neuron/human learns (atleast to a certain degree). Keep this in mind while answering the questions above. Your answers need not be technically accurate (but it would be appreciated) and can be loosely worded, but they MUST have some intuition backing them.
